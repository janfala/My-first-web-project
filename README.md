# My first JavaScript project - Calculator

## How long it took me 
- roughly 1.5 hours
  

## My coding experience at the point of this project:
- good at coding and understanding concepts in java and c#
- basic knowledge of html, css and javaScript, but first time writing it myself
- first time using vscode (maybe there is a reason why everyone uses it, it feels really nice and lightweight, probably because im used to Ide's)


## My thought after "finishing" it:
- Was really fun to design something from scratch, I'm really enjoying these programming-languages so far.
- I'm not really too happy with the calculator itself, since I know there can be errors somtimes.\
  (I am using eval() to calculate the result of the input. When it throws an error, I display "Invalid Operation" on the calculator.
- I know that this webpage is not mobile/resizing friendly (I think you call that responsive).\
   -> I defintly want to learn how to implement that in css
- Also, I kinda feel like I cheated, because I basically did no complicated logic since it all relies on the eval() function.
- Overall I would say it's an ok start into my javascript journey\
  -> I'm glad I didn't need any tutorials/ help to do this, only thing I got from google was the eval() function
- The code is probably really spaghetti (hey don't judge me! - it will get better!)
- Javascript feels like a modern version of java so far (syntax-wise). I'm interested to see what it can do and why my professor hates it lol


## Future goals and projects I want to do:
- get better at understanding the web-infrastructure in general, I know core concepts and modells, but I really wanna dive deeper.
- improve at html, css and js. -> after that, start learning typescript and something like React or Angular 
- start working with api requests and data
- also wan't to learn more python. (I feel like the basics are really simple, but there is soo much you can learn to improve efficiency)
- also i wan't to learn how to use git from the terminal, i feel like a noob doing it over gui
- My end goal (for now) is to create a path-finding and a resume webpage (maybe not the most creative projects lol)

Also, when i do larger project, i wanna use the readme like an update-log to collect my thoughts and progress.
